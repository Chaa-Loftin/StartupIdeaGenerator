# StartupIdeaGenerator

This is the second IOS application that I have created.  It buiild upon the methods and techniques that
I learned while creating the Magic8Ball application.  The main difference between the two is that this 
application updates two label components instead of one. The user can generate a business idea by using
one of two methods.  The first is by clicking the "generate idea!" method.  The second is by shaking 
thier iPhone.

The user is simply intended to click the "generate Idea!" button at the bottom of the screen or to shake
their iPhone.  Once this, button is clicked or the iphone is shaken, an internal method will select two 
elements from two seperate arrays. Each element assigned to a variable. Each of the labels are updated
with the value that has been saved to these variables.
